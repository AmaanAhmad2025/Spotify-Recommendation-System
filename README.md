# Spotify Recommendation System

## Overview
The **Spotify Recommendation System** is a machine learning project that suggests songs based on user preferences. It analyzes various audio features from a dataset and applies machine learning techniques to provide recommendations.

## Features
- Reads and processes a dataset containing song features.
- Cleans and analyzes data using Pandas and Seaborn.
- Implements a recommendation system based on song similarity.
- Uses visualizations to explore data insights.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AmaanAhmad2025/Spotify-Recommendation-System.git
   cd Spotify-Recommendation-System
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open `Recommendation System.ipynb` and run the cells.
3. View data analysis and recommendations.

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset (`data.csv`) containing various song attributes:
- Acousticness
- Danceability
- Energy
- Instrumentalness
- Liveness
- Loudness
- Speechiness
- Tempo
- Valence

## Model
The recommendation system is built using **similarity-based techniques**, comparing songs based on their audio features.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve model accuracy using deep learning techniques.
- Include collaborative filtering for better recommendations.
- Deploy as a web application.
